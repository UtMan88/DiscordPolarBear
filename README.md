This is a Discord Bot that plays the classic Polar Bear Game: https://www.pleacher.com/handley/puzzles/polrbear.html

Rules for the game are posted in the link above, but this is a fun way to stump your friends and turn them into life-long enemies.

Made with https://docs.stillu.cc/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html as a guide.
